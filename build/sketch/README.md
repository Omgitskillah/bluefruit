# E-INK OVER BLUETOOTH
Eink over BLE project written to run on the [Adafruit playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333)

Will start of using the Arduino IDE to program and leverage the simplicity of using the `.ino` `setup()` and `loop()` functions.

To successfully compile this project, install Arduino 1.8.19 then install the latest board support from Adafruit. Using older Arduino IDE with the latest Adafruit board support causes a compilation error where some modules can't be reached.
